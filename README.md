## So, what is Fantasy Fellowship all about?

This application allows the user to interact with data fetched from [an API.](https://the-one-api.dev/) This data, created by fans, includes information about Tolkien's characters. The user can view all characters fetched from the API (which have been filtered to select the most important), and add players to their 'Fellowship'. 

Future iterations include the addition of game logic to create a LOTR-themed fantasy football game, where the player's team will fight to get to Mordor against Sauron's scores.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- React v6
- React Router, including PropTypes
- Cypress

### Future Extensions

Additions include:
- Game logic, to mimic fantasy football with a dice roll determining the computer's scores
- Video / sound for each character
- Custom styling
- Featured data including quotes, movie clips, etc.
